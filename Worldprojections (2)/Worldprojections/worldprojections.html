    <h1>HW 3</h1>
    
    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2> -->
    <p>I used the Inicatrix Plug-in on QGIS to place the caps on the map. I could then change the projection by clicking on a variety of different ones offered under the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) tab under the Project Properties tab in QGIS.</p>
    
    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>As indicated by the red circles or "caps" on the map, the Pseudo Mercator Map distorts the size of the continents. The caps show this, as they do not vary in shape (they are still all perfect circles), but do in size. The bigger circles being toward the poles indicates that continents near the north and south pole appear bigger relative to the other contints than it actually is. For example, Greenland appears to be the same size as the continent of Africa. However, because Greenland is closer to the north pole it is beiing distorted int his projection to look a lot bigger than reality.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>This projection distorts the the size as well as the shape of the the continents. Which is made appaernt by the varying size and shape of the caps on the map. </h3>

<h2>World Projection Equal Area</h2>
<h3>The caps on this map seem to only vary in shape. Some of the circles being oblong ellipses, and some being perfect round circles. However, the actual size or "area" or each circle seems to be consisent. Indicating that the map displays accurate sizing of the continents but a distortion of shape. </h3>

<h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
<h3>The projection name of this map has "equidistant" in title, which means that teh map does not distort the distant of the continents. It appears as though a cone was placed on the north pole of the earth and then unrolled to reveal this map.</h3>

<h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
<h3>This is an azimuthal and equidistant projection indicating that direction and the distance of the map is not distorted.</h3>

<h2>Sphere Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
<h3>This is a spherical map meaning a projection of the round earth was transferred into a flat image directly, and this specific projection is azimuthal meanining it preserves the true direction undistorted.</h3>

<h2>Sphere Bonne</h2>
<h3>This map maintains accurate shape of continents but distorts direction and distance.</h3>

    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
