    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2> -->
    <!-- <p>I used the Inicatrix Plug-in on QGIS to place the caps on the map. I could then change the projection by clicking on a variety of different ones offered under the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) tab under the Project Properties tab in QGIS.</p> -->
    
    <h2>Natural Break Categorization</h2>
    <h3>As indicated by the red circles or "caps" on the map, the Pseudo Mercator Map distorts the size of the continents. The caps show this, as they do not vary in shape (they are still all perfect circles), but do in size. The bigger circles being toward the poles indicates that continents near the north and south pole appear bigger relative to the other continents than it actually is. For example, Greenland appears to be the same size as the continent of Africa. However, because Greenland is closer to the north pole it is being distorted in this projection to look a lot bigger than reality.</h3>

    <h2>Equal Interval</h2>
    <h3>This projection distorts the the size as well as the shape of the the continents. Which is made appaernt by the varying size and shape of the caps on the map. </h3>

    <!-- <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
