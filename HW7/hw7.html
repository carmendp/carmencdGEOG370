    <h2>HW 7</h2>
    <h3>To access my data for this map I went to "SimplyAnalytics.com", sorted by counties in the U.S., chose the technology tab, then picked "the # of computers in households 2021" dataset.</h3>
    <h3>This is a map categorized by Equal quantile. The map displays the amount of household with computer per county in each U.S. county. For some reason a couple of the state are completel whited out, I belie this is because there was insufficient data for these states. I added a north and a scale to my map, but to display this information specifically it is not necessary, because the direction or size does not effect the information.</h3>
